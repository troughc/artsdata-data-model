## Artsdata Data Model v{{ site.data.versions.schemaVersion}}

A simple data model for Performing Arts Events and related Places, People and Organizations. 

The classes and properties used in Artsdata represent a “thin” layer of data
roughly specified by [Google Event Structured Data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/event).  The main difference is that Artsdata enforces links between entities within Artsdata and interlinks URIs outside of Artsdata including links to Wikidata and other LOD sources.  Artsdata also generates unique global identifiers (IRIs also called URIs) for classes such as Event, Person, Place, and Organization.

Here are the main Classes used in Artsdata.

### Classes

<ol>
{% for class in site.classes %}
<li>
    <a href="{{ base }}{{ class.url }}">
        {{ class.class_name }}
    </a>
</li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>

There is also a [PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=10-bnlDKv7w7LREakZ9b40BajbY39gbhJ) of the data that [Footlight](https://www.culturecreates.com/en/index.html#vision) feeds into Artsdata.  At the moment, the data that Footlight published on the websites of arts organizations and the data in Artsdata are very similar, but as more and more sources feed into Artsdata, the shape of the data between Footlight and Artsdata may diverge, with Footlight being a subset of classes and properties collected in Artsdata.
